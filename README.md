# Rust-practice
These are the rust source code file I created as I learned Rust with the official docs, as well as a PDF of the notes that I made as I was learning.

Each folder contains just the code files in the src folder, and the project's cargo.toml file. As a result, these cargo projects are all unbuilt.

Some of the projects, like chapter 1, include some crates, downloaded from crates.io, that are used in the code. These crates should however, be hopefully obvious given the use statements at the top of the file. In order to test this code, you can simply create a new cargo project, place the files in the src folder, and then edit the dependencies of that project accordingly.
